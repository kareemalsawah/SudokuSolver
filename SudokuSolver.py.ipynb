Then it assumes the value if one of the squares by its value and removes all of the configurations that violate the constraints. If one of the squares has no remaining possible values, then the inital assumption is wrong and another is tried. AC3 is the one that removes configurations taht violate the constraints. BTS is like a DFS where it assumes the value of an element. It chooses what element to set using the Minimum Remaining values heuristic (MRV). It chooses the variables with least possible choices remaining."
